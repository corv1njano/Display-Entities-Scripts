# Display Entity Scripts
This small software, written in Python, allows you to generate custom files that create different color and wood types varients for display entities in Minecraft Java.

## Who is this for and what's the purpose?
If you create display entity models and want your model to be available in either all 16 Minecraft colors or all 10 wood varients, you can use this program to auto generate these files.

## Disclaimer
The is my first ever Python software. I only used to quickly generate an application without much effort. This source code can be found [here](https://github.com/corv1njano/Display-Entities-Scripts/tree/main/src). As of release 1.4 the software is completly finished and there are no more plans for additional features.
